reddit-w8-app
=============

The basic start of a Windows 8 Reddit App. I've tried to make a pretty clean implementation of a Reddit client using Windows 8 and MVVMLight. I hope that this app will serve as a decent template for those looking to create apps of an intermediate complexity. 

Right now it supports the following features:

  - Browsing Subreddits
  - Viewing links and comments on posts
  - Logging in to view your personal list of Subreddits

On the short-term road-map I'm looking at implementing the following features:

  - The ability to upvote/downvote posts and comments
  - The ability to comment on posts and other comments
  - The ability to view user profiles and send/receive messages 
  - Custom viewers for Imgur and YouTube links

At that point it should be a pretty fully-featured Reddit client.
